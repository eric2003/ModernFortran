!Try the following example to understand all the logical operators available in Fortran âˆ’

program logicalOp
! this program checks logical operators
implicit none

   ! variable declaration
   logical :: a, b
   
   ! assigning values
   a = .true.
   b = .false.
   
   if (a .and. b) then
      print *, "Line 1 - Condition is true"
   else
      print *, "Line 1 - Condition is false"
   end if
   
   if (a .or. b) then
      print *, "Line 2 - Condition is true"
   else
      print *, "Line 2 - Condition is false"
   end if
   
   ! changing values
   a = .false.
   b = .true.
   
   if (.not.(a .and. b)) then
