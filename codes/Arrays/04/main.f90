!Array Sections
!So far we have referred to the whole array, Fortran provides an easy way to refer several elements, 
!or a section of an array, using a single statement.
!To access an array section, you need to provide the lower and the upper bound of the section, 
!as well as a stride (increment), for all the dimensions. This notation is called a subscript triplet:
!array ([lower]:[upper][:stride], ...)
!When no lower and upper bounds are mentioned, it defaults to the extents you declared, and stride value defaults to 1.
!The following example demonstrates the concept âˆ’

program arraySubsection

   real, dimension(10) :: a, b
   integer:: i, asize, bsize
   
   a(1:7) = 5.0 ! a(1) to a(7) assigned 5.0
   a(8:) = 0.0  ! rest are 0.0 
   b(2:10:2) = 3.9
   b(1:9:2) = 2.5
   
   !display
   asize = size(a)
   bsize = size(b)
   
   do i = 1, asize
      Print *, a(i)
   end do
   
   do i = 1, bsize
      Print *, b(i)
   end do
   
end program arraySubsection
