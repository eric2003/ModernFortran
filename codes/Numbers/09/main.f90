!The Kind Specifier
!In scientific programming, one often needs to know the range and precision of data of the hardware platform
!on which the work is being done.
!The intrinsic function kind() allows you to query the details
!of the hardwareâ€™s data representations before running a program.

program kindCheck
implicit none
   
   integer :: i 
   real :: r 
   complex :: cp 
   print *,' Integer ', kind(i) 
   print *,' Real ', kind(r) 
   print *,' Complex ', kind(cp) 
   
end program kindCheck
